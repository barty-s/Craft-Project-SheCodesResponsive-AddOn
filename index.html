            <h3>A fun and addictive sport</h3>
            <p>
              Surfing is a great sport for people of all ages, abilities and
              styles. You might like to do tricks, like aerials, or get
              barrelled inside a perfectly shaped wave. Or you might prefer to
              hang-ten and cruise on a never-ending peeling wave on a long
              board. It's a sport loved by many and, provided you have the right
              kind of gear, can be practiced in any climate, from the cooler
              Atlantic ocean to the balmy Mediterranean. Once you catch your
              first wave, you'll be hooked!

                <p>
                  An exposed sandbar break in the north of Co.Kerry, Ireland,
                  Banna has decent conditions year-round, with the best time of
                  year being during the spring. Wetsuits are a must, even in
                  summer, as the water can be quite cold and there's usually a
                  sea-breeze to add to the chill-factor. The waves at Banna are
                  generally small to medium sized, perfect for
                  beginner/intermediate surfers.

                <p>
                  This was the beach where I first learned to surf, so it has a
                  lot of fond memories for me! It's a beautiful long empty beach
                  with never-ending dunes and gorgeous views of the mountians to
                  the right.

                <p>
                  This is an exposed beach and reef break with very good
                  conditions through-out the year. The beach break provides both
                  left and right-hand waves and the reef offers a nice
                  left-hander. The great thing about this beach is that the surf
                  isn't affected by the tide, making it a very accessible beach
                  for surfers. The best conditions are in the winter time, so
                  wrapping up well is a must!

                  A beautiful beach in a special location with amazing views,
                  you can even see the island of Ons. It's not the easiest beach
                  to reach, you need a car to access it, but that's what makes
                  it great - it's never over-crowded.

                  "Where an inch is a mile"! This beach stretches for 3
                  kilometres. Another fairly exposed beach break, it has quite
                  consistent surf. The best time of year for surfing at Inch is
                  during the spring, espcially in April. It has both left and
                  right-handers and is best at mid-tide. Another beach on the
                  Atlantic, so bring along your neoprene booties, gloves and
                  maybe a hood too, just in case!

                  Another beach I visited in my childhood, it feels like it goes
                  on forever because you can't see the end of it! The surf here
                  is so fun and the scenery from the water is breath-taking.

              countries have lots to offer to surfers, sailors, wind-surfers and
